        <div class = "block">
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am very excited to have you here with me as I begin my journey to becoming an exceptional Software Engineer!</p>
        <h3 class = "subheader">About</h3>
        <p>I grew up in the sunny city of Charleston, South Carolina where I mostly hung out with friends and dabbled in garage bands for the better
            part of my high school years. After high school, I moved to 
            Orlando, Florida where I worked in a variety of restaurants in Disney World and Universal Studios for almost ten years. I had a great deal of 
            fun and met a wide variety of people that came through the area. These years allowed me to learn more about who I am, what I want for my future,
            and what kind of work would be both rewarding personally as well as financially suitable for my goals. I discovered through the years that I 
            think very analytically as well as I really enjoy building things. This led me to try my had at programming. I spent several years teaching myself
            how to write in a handful of languages including Python, Java, C++, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subheader">Goals</h3>
        <p>My goal with this program is to learn as much as I can so that I can take that knowledge into a new career</p>
        <p>Once I complete the course, I will look for an entry level job to begin my career</p>
        <p>After I find a job, I plan to marry by beautiful fiance and travel the world with her!</p>
